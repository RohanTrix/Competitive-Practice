/*
 *      IDEA : The problem cannot be solved using Topo Sort/ BFS from indeg=0 kinda approach. This is a little tricky to catch.
 *             but there are test cases that will fail on that.
 * 
 *             Looking at the constraints is a clear hint for Bitmask DP. We want to find the min amt of sems
 *             to complete all courses (FULL MASK).
 *             
 *             DP STATE : dp[mask] = Min no. of sem to complete courses dentoed by set bits in mask
 * 
 *             Algo:
 *                  1) First we built a prereq array that maps i -> mask of set bits of courses which are immediate prereq of i
 *                  2) We iterate on all masks. 
 *                     First, we will build a mask `canTake` that denotes courses that can be taken in 1 sem. There are 2 checks for this
 *                             - Course should not already be completed.
 *                             - All the prereq of the course should already be completed. This is done by ANDing mask with preqreq[i] and checking if equal to prereq.
 *                               since if any bit NOT SET in the mask but SET in prereq[i]...it will result in 0 when ANDing....and so this AND value will never equal
 *                               to prereq of i.
 *                  
 *                  3) Now we use the technique of Submask Enumeration( https://cp-algorithms.com/algebra/all-submasks.html ). This will give us a
 *                     all the subsets of canTake. Out of all the subsets of canTake...we only consider the subsets where the courses taken are <=k.
 *                     This is simply done by counting the bits in the submask. `take` denotes the current subset of doable courses we take in 1 sem together.
 *                     
 *                  4) Already taken courses (`mask`) + New taken courses(`take`) can be acheived by (mask | take).
 *                     The ans for dp[mask | take] will be MIN(1 + dp[mask])
 *
