# Problem Description

Given an integer array A containing N integers.

You need to divide the array A into two subsets S1 and S2 such that the absolute difference between their sums is minimum.

Find and return this minimum possible absolute difference.

NOTE:

Subsets can contain elements from A in any order (not necessary to be contiguous).
Each element of A should belong to any one subset S1 or S2, not both.
It may be possible that one subset remains empty.


Problem Constraints
1 <= N <= 100

1 <= A[i] <= 100



Input Format
First and only argument is an integer array A.



Output Format
Return an integer denoting the minimum possible difference among the sums of two subsets.
